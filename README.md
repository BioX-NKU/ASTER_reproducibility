# The reproducibility of ASTER

**The source code for the reproduction of results in "ASTER: accurately estimating the number of cell types in single-cell chromatin accessibility data". <br/>**

- We provide a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/BioX-NKU/ASTER_reproducibility/blob/main/example.ipynb) accompanying with [example data](https://github.com/BioX-NKU/ASTER_reproducibility/blob/main/BoneMarrow.h5ad) for running ASTER.
- We also provide a [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/epiaster/) for the convenience of the community.
- Find more details on the [GitHub](https://github.com/BioX-NKU/ASTER) and the [Documentation](https://aster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) of ASTER.
